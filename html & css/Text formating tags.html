    <b>
    All this means that you get to spend less time focusing on your web framework tool choice and more time focusing on your web app.
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Django also has<b> <I>Long Term Support (LTS)</I> </b> versions. I don’t think that the average developer or company should use them. If you upgrade from an older LTS to a newer LTS, there are going to be more changes. Each Long Term Support version is farther from the next than compared to regular version upgrades.
  </p>
  <p>
   <u> Long Term Support versions</u> are <Strike>specifically </Strike> targeted at companies that have slow and<sup> cumbersome upgrade cycles</sup> where it’s difficult to <sub>integrate new versions.</sub>
