    Django also has Long Term Support (LTS) versions. I don’t think that the average developer or company should use them. If you upgrade from an older LTS to a newer LTS, there are going to be more changes. Each Long Term Support version is farther from the next than compared to regular version upgrades.

    Long Term Support versions are specifically targeted at companies that have slow and cumbersome upgrade cycles where it’s difficult to integrate new versions.
